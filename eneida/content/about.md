Greetings, Operator, and welcome to my interactive portfolio!

You've accessed a terminal interface designed to showcase my skills and projects in a unique, retro-modern style. This isn't just a static page â€“ it's an environment where you can explore files, uncover hidden details, and maybe even play a game or two.

My name is Aaron Postels, a Digital Media student at the University of Bremen focusing on Game Development, Web Development, creative coding, and electronics. I love learning new things and building interactive experiences that evoke feeling.

Use the `help` command to discover available commands and navigate through my work. Explore projects like `project_duckslayer` (Godot game) or `project_useek` (interactive web puzzle), and check out skills like `skill_unity` or `skill_js`.

Feel free to explore! Connect via `contact` if you'd like to reach out.
