Greetings, Operator.

My name is Aaron Postels. I am a Digital Media Bachelor student at the University of Bremen.

My focus areas include Game Development (Unity, Godot, Unreal), Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS, GSAP, Three.js), and programming in Python, Java, C#, and C++. I also have experience with electronics (Arduino), 3D modelling (Blender), and camera work (photo/video).

I'm passionate about exploring new technologies, continuously learning, and creating interactive projects designed to evoke emotion and engage users.

This terminal serves as an interactive portfolio. Use the 'help' command to navigate my skills and projects.

Let's create something memorable. Connect via 'contact'.
