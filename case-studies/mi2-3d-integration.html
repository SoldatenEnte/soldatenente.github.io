        <section><h2>Project Overview</h2><p>This semester-long project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the entire 3D digital content creation pipeline. It follows the journey of a single concept—a whimsical traffic light on wheels—from a simple sketch to two distinct final products: a realistic visual effects composite and a playable game prototype. This showcases the ability to take an idea from a basic drawing to a fully realized, interactive experience.</p></section>

        <section><h2>Key Features</h2><ul><li><strong>Concept & Sketching:</strong> The project began with initial concept sketches, establishing the design for the mobile traffic light character.</li><li><strong>3D Modeling:</strong> A detailed 3D model of the "Ampel Racer" character was created from scratch in Blender.</li><li><strong>Texturing & Rendering:</strong> The model was fully textured and rendered in Blender, producing a high-quality showcase image with realistic materials and lighting.</li><li><strong>VFX Integration:</strong> A real-world video was motion-tracked in Blender, and the animated 3D model was then composited into the footage with realistic lighting and shadows.</li><li><strong>Game Implementation:</strong> The final asset was imported into Unreal Engine 5, where a playable speedrun-style parkour game was developed.</li></ul></section>
