        <section><h2>Project Overview</h2><p>Toolbox is a modern web application offering a suite of functional utilities like a QR Code Generator and JSON Formatter. The project's core focus is delivering a seamless and highly polished user experience, where every interaction, transition, and visual element is meticulously crafted for robustness and aesthetic appeal across all devices. This was achieved using a cutting-edge stack including React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4, unified by a cohesive design and fluid animations managed by the Motion library.</p></section>
        <section><h2>Tech Stack</h2><ul class="tech-stack-list"><li>React 19</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>Tailwind CSS v4</li><li>Motion (Animation)</li><li>Radix UI</li><li>React Router</li><li>Vite</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>Key Features</h2><ul><li>Advanced Utility Tools: A suite of functional utilities, including a feature-rich QR Code Generator (with color picking, logo embedding, and multiple download formats) and a robust JSON Formatter/Validator.</li><li>Polished UX & Micro-Interactions: Fluid page transitions are managed by Motion, while a curated set of interactive components like `FuzzyText` and `ClickSpark` adds a unique, tactile feel to the user experience.</li><li>Headless UI & Accessibility: Built upon Radix UI primitives for robust accessibility standards, ensuring the custom-styled components are functional and reliable for all users.</li><li>Modular & Scalable Structure: Organized with a clear separation of concerns, with a central tool configuration that makes feature expansion straightforward and maintainable.</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2><p>The primary challenge was orchestrating a diverse set of technologies—including React Router for navigation, Motion for UI animations, and a custom component library—into a single, robust, and visually seamless application. The goal was to eliminate layout shifts, ensure all animations were fluid, and maintain a pixel-perfect, responsive design. This was solved by leveraging Motion's `AnimatePresence` to manage page transitions gracefully, preventing jarring content shifts. A strict, component-based architecture combined with Tailwind CSS v4's utility-first approach ensured visual consistency and maintainability. The core of the solution was a rigorous focus on the fine-tuning of animation timings, easing curves, and responsive breakpoints to achieve the project's primary goal: a superior level of professional polish and a completely seamless user experience.</p></section>
