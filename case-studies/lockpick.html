        <section><h2>Project Overview</h2><p>This project is a mobile-first, timing-based lockpicking minigame designed to simulate a classic RPG mechanic using pure front-end technologies. The core mechanic involves a rapidly rotating needle that must be stopped precisely within a dynamically sized target zone across multiple concentric rings. The game features configurable difficulty, dramatic CSS-based success/failure animations, and full responsiveness, ensuring an engaging experience that requires timing and precision on both desktop and mobile devices.</p></section>
        <section><h2>Tech Stack</h2><ul class="tech-stack-list"><li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li><li>HTML5</li><li>CSS3 (Transitions & Transforms)</li><li>requestAnimationFrame API</li><li>Mobile-First Design</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>Key Features</h2><ul><li>Responsive, pure CSS rendering of the lock mechanism using pseudo-elements and conic gradients for the target zones.</li><li>Real-time animation loop managed by JavaScript's <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> for smooth, precision-based needle rotation.</li><li>Dynamic difficulty scaling controlled by a slider, influencing both the needle rotation speed and the size of the target success zone.</li><li>Multi-stage challenge system requiring the player to successfully "pick" concentric rings sequentially to unlock the final goal.</li><li>Advanced CSS animations for visual feedback, including success pulses, screen shakes on failure, and a dramatic 'unlocked' explosion effect.</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2><p>The main technical challenge involved accurately rendering the circular target zones when they cross the 360/0-degree boundary, ensuring the success zone is visually correct and the logic handles the wrap-around check correctly. This was solved in two parts: first, by dynamically generating a multi-part <code>conic-gradient</code> in JavaScript when the target zone was detected to span the zero-degree mark, and second, by implementing boundary logic that checks if the needle angle falls between the start and end angles OR if the end angle has wrapped past 360 degrees and the needle is in either of the two resulting angular segments.</p></section>
