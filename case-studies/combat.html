        <section><h2>Project Overview</h2><p>This project is a turn-based RPG combat simulator built from the ground up using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The core of the game is its engaging, two-part attack sequence that requires player skill. First, a timing-based "Charge" minigame, utilizing `requestAnimationFrame` for a smooth, accelerating meter, determines the base damage. This is immediately followed by a fast-paced, reaction-based "Fury" minigame where players tap dynamically spawning targets to build a damage multiplier. This system creates a rewarding and interactive alternative to traditional static menu-based combat.</p></section>
        <section><h2>Tech Stack</h2><ul class="tech-stack-list"><li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li><li>HTML5</li><li>CSS3 Animations & Transitions</li><li>DOM API</li><li>requestAnimationFrame API</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>Key Features</h2><ul><li>A unique two-phase attack system combining a timing minigame for base damage and a reaction minigame for a damage multiplier.</li><li>Sophisticated visual feedback, including a procedural damage number animation that merges, combines, and flies towards the target.</li><li>Clean game flow managed by a finite state machine logic, ensuring predictable and bug-free transitions between game states (e.g., player turn, enemy turn, minigames).</li><li>Performance-conscious animation loops using `requestAnimationFrame` for the charge minigame, guaranteeing a smooth experience regardless of device refresh rate.</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2><p>The main challenge was creating a polished, multi-stage damage animation sequence without relying on an external game engine or animation library. The solution involved choreographing a series of CSS transitions and keyframe animations, precisely triggered by JavaScript `setTimeout` functions. A dedicated function dynamically generates the required DOM elements for the base damage and multiplier, then manipulates their CSS classes in a timed sequence to create the illusion of the numbers merging, transforming into a final damage value, and flying towards the enemy before being removed from the DOM.</p></section>
