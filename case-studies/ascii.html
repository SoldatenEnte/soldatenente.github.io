            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project is a high-performance ASCII art generator that converts video playback into a stylized, real-time text animation directly in the browser. It leverages the HTML5 Canvas and Video APIs to capture frames, which are then passed to a dedicated Web Worker for intensive processing. This multi-threaded approach ensures the main UI thread remains unblocked, resulting in a smooth and responsive user experience. The renderer includes features like color quantization, brightness/saturation controls, and dynamic resizing to create a visually compelling, retro-tech aesthetic.</p>

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>The primary technical challenge was processing every pixel of each video frame in real-time without freezing the main browser thread, which would lead to a laggy, unresponsive animation. This was solved by architecting the application around the Web Workers API. The main script captures video frames and transfers the raw pixel data to a background worker thread. This worker handles all computationally expensive tasks—calculating luminance, mapping to ASCII characters, and quantizing colors—allowing the main thread to focus solely on rendering the previously processed frame, thus ensuring a fluid, high-framerate animation and a responsive user interface.</p>
