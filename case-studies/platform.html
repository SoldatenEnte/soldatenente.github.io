        <section><h2>Project Overview</h2><p>This project is a real-time 3D web simulation of a motorized 3-axis Stewart platform, developed to visualize and test inverse kinematics algorithms before deployment on physical hardware. The simulator, built with React and Three.js (React Three Fiber), allows users to control the platform's roll and pitch angles or manipulate individual actuator heights. It accurately calculates the required actuator positions to achieve the desired orientation, providing a crucial tool for debugging and demonstrating the complex mathematics involved. An interactive control panel powered by Tweakpane offers real-time manipulation of all system parameters.</p></section>

        <section><h2>Key Features</h2><ul><li>Real-time 3D visualization of a 3-axis Stewart platform and its components.</li><li>Accurate inverse kinematics simulation converting target roll/pitch angles into individual actuator heights.</li><li>Interactive control panel (Tweakpane) for manipulating platform radius, actuator distance, target angles, and manual actuator heights.</li><li>Dual control modes: "Target Angle" for kinematic simulation and "Manual" for direct actuator control.</li><li>A physics-based ball simulation on the platform's surface to visually demonstrate stability and tilt.</li><li>Includes a separate <a href="/projects/platform/actuator/" target="_blank">single actuator simulation</a> to demonstrate its individual motion and homing sequence.</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2><p>The primary technical challenge was implementing the inverse kinematics algorithm to accurately translate desired roll and pitch angles into the precise vertical heights for each of the three actuators in real-time. This was solved by deriving the geometric equations within a React Three Fiber <code>useFrame</code> hook, which runs on every rendered frame. The algorithm calculates a target platform plane based on the input roll/pitch, then solves for the intersection points of the vertical actuator axes with this plane to determine the required heights. This ensures the 3D model's movement is a faithful and performant representation of the mathematical model.</p></section>
