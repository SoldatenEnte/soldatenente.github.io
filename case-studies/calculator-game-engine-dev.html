        <section><h2>Project Overview</h2><p>This entry chronicles a multi-year personal challenge, born within the locked-down environment of a school-issued iPad: to push an enhanced, emulated TI-83 graphing calculator far beyond its intended purpose. Driven by pure curiosity, I set out to transform this unique tool into a capable game development environment by engineering solutions to problems that most developers take for granted, sparking a deep dive into the emulator's architecture.</p></section>

        <section><h2>Key Features & Discoveries</h2><ul><li><strong>Custom Game Engine:</strong> Designed and built a rudimentary engine in TI-BASIC capable of running both turn-based and real-time games, achieving real-time action with a processor-bound loop to approximate frame rates.</li><li><strong>A Library of Games:</strong> The engine was used to create a portfolio of fully playable games that became popular among fellow students, including _Chess_, a complete version of _2048_ with a self-playing AI, and a functional clone of _Flappy Bird_.</li><li><strong>System Vulnerability Discovery:</strong> Through deep analysis, I discovered a critical flaw in the emulator's save-state system, leading to an exploit where a controlled crash could bypass all exam security measures undetected.</li></ul></section>
