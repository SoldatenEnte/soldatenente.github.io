        <section><h2>Project Overview</h2><p>Eneida is an immersive portfolio that simulates a retro-futuristic, sci-fi themed desktop environment directly in the browser. It moves beyond a traditional website by offering a fully interactive experience where users navigate projects and skills via a command-line interface and a simulated filesystem. The environment features a robust, modular window manager for displaying content and launching playable classic games like Pong, Tetris, and Snake. To enhance engagement, it includes a "system compromise" mode with dynamic visual effects and persistent, real-time leaderboards for the games, powered by Google Firestore.</p></section>

        <section><h2>Key Features</h2><ul><li>A simulated operating system with a command-line interface for navigating portfolio content from a virtual filesystem.</li><li>A dynamic, modular window manager for displaying content, images, and playable games in draggable windows.</li><li>Three fully playable classic games (Pong, Tetris, Snake) built with the Canvas API, featuring multiple modes and difficulty levels.</li><li>Real-time, persistent leaderboards for games, integrated with Google Firestore for data storage and retrieval.</li><li>An interactive "system compromise" mode that triggers a variety of visual glitch effects and disruptive UI events, showcasing advanced DOM manipulation.</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2><p>The primary architectural challenge was managing state and interactions between numerous independent modules—such as the terminal, window manager, multiple Canvas-based games, and effects system—without creating tight coupling. This was solved by implementing a centralized "context" object in the main application entry point. This object holds shared application state and provides a stable API of functions (e.g., `displayOutput`, `createWindow`, `saveGameScore` to Firebase) that are passed down to each module upon initialization. This dependency injection pattern effectively decouples the modules, allowing them to communicate and access shared resources through a single, controlled interface, which makes the system highly scalable and maintainable.</p></section>
